**Scavapack Installation Tutorial**

**Join my [Discord server.](https://discord.gg/eCJu56tpDq)**

1) Go to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/scavapack
2) Download the pack
3) Download Optifine from the "Optifine" button if you don't already have it, make sure to download for the version the pack is; if you don't you'll just have to modify
the .mcmeta folder.
4) Open Optifine and install it

# **Use Tutorial**
1) Unzip the pack (I'd kindly enjoy if you read the "Contributions" folder in the pack just to see the credit to resource packs I used and more; if you wish to re-disturibute my pack please contact me in a ticket in my discord server for the pack.)
2) If you don't want the play the pack on version it's created for change the pack.mcmeta (VSCode is recommended for .mcmeta & .properties files)
3) Change the number from 9 to the version you want
(example: 6 would be 1.16, 7 would be 1.17, 8 would be 1.18 and 9 is 1.19)

# **Some models won't load?**
If you have models that load in the pack & some that don't then this means the pack is working, make sure to check the properties folder for the item in
assets->minecraft->optifine->cit for which there may be a "nbt.display.Name=iregex: Name" what this does is make it so the model only loads if the item of the model
is named after the model.

Another reason for this issue is you are using [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and you do not have [OptiFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric) installed.
